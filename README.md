<h1>Plasma</h1>

A code time tracker. Mainly meant for me to gamify my coding to incentivize me to code more. Eventually will have a nice GUI and stuffs, but right now its very very early in production.

Recommended to add to startup to ensure that your code editor is always being logged.


<h2> Build: </h2>
Install the requirements listed in "go.mod" then run "go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui"
